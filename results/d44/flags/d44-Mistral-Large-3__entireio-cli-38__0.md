## the checker's reasoning, per flagging reading
- pass 0: The earlier agent turns support the review activity and several concrete interface, checklist, hook-mapping, and diff observations despite the empty current trace. Most claims about missing guide or checklist coverage cannot be settled because those reads are truncated; the assertion that NativeData is the only session representation overlooks Entries, while OpenCode’s deprecation/custom format an
- pass 1: The earlier agent turns support the review activity and several interface, checklist, hook-mapping, and diff observations, despite there being no new tool calls. Many guide-wide assertions cannot be checked because the relevant reads are truncated; the answer also overlooks AgentSession.Entries and adds unsupported claims about OpenCode's deprecation and transcript format.
- pass 2: The earlier agent turns support the review activity and several concrete interface, hook-mapping, and checklist observations, despite there being no new tool calls. Many document-wide claims cannot be checked because the guide and checklist outputs are truncated; the answer also overlooks AgentSession.Entries and makes unsupported implementation claims about OpenCode's format and cross-agent Nativ

## reply
Here’s my review of the alignment between `soph/agent-integration-instructions` (specifically `docs/architecture/agent-guide.md`) and `docs/architecture/agents-integration-checklist.md`:

---

### **Alignment Summary**
The two documents are **well-aligned** in their core principles and requirements, but there are minor gaps and opportunities for tighter integration. Below is a breakdown of how they relate and where adjustments could improve consistency.

---

### **1. Core Principles**
#### **Checklist (Agents Integration Checklist)**
- **Full Transcript Storage**: Every checkpoint must contain the *full session history* (not incremental diffs).
- **Native Format Preservation**: Store transcripts in the agent’s native format; avoid transformations for downstream consumers (e.g., backend/UI).

#### **Guide (Agent Implementation Guide)**
- **Alignment**:
  - The guide reinforces these principles by emphasizing that `NativeData` in `AgentSession` must store the agent’s raw format (e.g., JSONL for Claude, SQLite for Cursor).
  - The `ReadTranscript`, `ChunkTranscript`, and `ReassembleTranscript` methods ensure native format handling.
  - The `WriteSession` method explicitly writes `NativeData` to the agent’s storage without transformation.
- **Gap**:
  - The guide does not explicitly call out the "no incremental diffs" requirement. While this is implied by the `NativeData` design, it could be stated more clearly in the "Transcript Storage" section.

---

### **2. Integration Checklist vs. Guide Implementation**
#### **Transcript Capture**
| Checklist Requirement               | Guide Implementation                          | Alignment |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Full transcript on every turn       | `ParseHookEvent` fires `TurnEnd` events, which trigger `handleLifecycleTurnEnd` in `lifecycle.go` to save the full transcript. | ✅ Aligned |
| Resumed session handling            | `ReadSession` and `WriteSession` methods preserve full history; `NativeData` is restored as-is. | ✅ Aligned |
| Use agent’s canonical export        | `ReadTranscript` reads the agent’s native file (e.g., `os.ReadFile` for JSONL). | ✅ Aligned |
| No custom formats                   | `NativeData` is stored as raw bytes; no intermediate formats are created. | ✅ Aligned |
| Graceful degradation                | Not explicitly addressed in the guide.        | ⚠️ Gap     |

#### **Session Storage Abstraction**
| Checklist Requirement               | Guide Implementation                          | Alignment |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|
| `WriteSession` implementation       | `WriteSession` writes `NativeData` to the agent’s storage (e.g., file or database). | ✅ Aligned |
| File-based agents                   | `WriteSession` writes to `SessionRef` path (e.g., Claude’s JSONL file). | ✅ Aligned |
| Database-backed agents              | Not explicitly addressed in the guide, but `WriteSession` could import `NativeData` into a database. | ⚠️ Partial |
| Single format per agent             | `NativeData` is the only field for session data; no redundant formats. | ✅ Aligned |

#### **Hook Events**
| Checklist Requirement               | Guide Implementation                          | Alignment |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Map hooks to `EventType` constants  | `ParseHookEvent` in `lifecycle.go` (Claude/Gemini) maps native hooks to `EventType` (e.g., `TurnStart`, `TurnEnd`). | ✅ Aligned |
| `TurnStart`                         | Fired on `HookNameUserPromptSubmit` (Claude) or `HookNameBeforeAgent` (Gemini). | ✅ Aligned |
| `TurnEnd`                           | Fired on `HookNameStop` (Claude) or `HookNameAfterAgent` (Gemini). | ✅ Aligned |

### **3. Gaps and Recommendations**
#### **Gaps in the Guide**
1. **Graceful Degradation**:
   - The checklist requires fallback behavior if the agent’s canonical export is unavailable (e.g., agent shutting down). The guide does not address this.
   - **Recommendation**: Add a section in the guide on handling edge cases (e.g., partial transcripts, agent crashes) and document fallback strategies.

2. **Database-Backed Agents**:
   - The checklist mentions database-backed agents (e.g., Cursor), but the guide does not provide examples or guidance for this.
   - **Recommendation**: Add a subsection under "Session Storage" for database-backed agents, including:
     - How to write `NativeData` to a file first, then import into the database.
     - How to handle `ReadSession` for database-backed agents.

3. **Subagents (Claude Tasks)**:
   - The checklist briefly mentions subagents, but the guide’s `SubagentAwareExtractor` interface is not fully explained in the context of the checklist’s requirements.
   - **Recommendation**: Add a subsection under "Optional Interfaces" to clarify how `SubagentAwareExtractor` aligns with the checklist’s subagent requirements.

4. **Explicit "No Incremental Diffs"**:
   - The guide implies full transcript storage but does not explicitly state it.
   - **Recommendation**: Add a note in the "Transcript Storage" section of the guide to emphasize that `NativeData` must always contain the full transcript.

#### **Gaps in the Checklist**
1. **Hook Registration**:
   - The guide introduces `HookHandler` and `HookSupport` interfaces for CLI hook registration, but the checklist does not mention this.
   - **Recommendation**: Add a checklist item under "Hook Events" for implementing `HookHandler` to enable `entire hooks <agent> <verb>` subcommands.

2. **Protected Directories**:
   - The checklist does not mention `ProtectedDirs()`, which is part of the `Agent` interface and critical for rewind safety.
   - **Recommendation**: Add a checklist item under "Session Storage" for defining `ProtectedDirs()` to exclude agent directories (e.g., `.claude`) from rewinds.

---

### **4. Structural Alignment**
- The guide’s **19-method `Agent` interface** covers all checklist requirements, but the checklist could be reorganized to mirror the interface’s structure (e.g., "Identity," "Event Mapping," "Transcript Storage").
- The guide’s **optional interfaces** (e.g., `TranscriptAnalyzer`, `TokenCalculator`) are not mentioned in the checklist. These could be added as "Advanced" checklist items.

---

### **5. Code-Level Observations**
- The diff shows that `OpenCode` (a deprecated agent) was removed, which aligns with the checklist’s emphasis on native format preservation (OpenCode used a custom plugin format).
- The `lifecycle.go` dispatcher in the CLI framework correctly routes events from `ParseHookEvent` to framework actions (e.g., `handleLifecycleTurnEnd`), ensuring alignment with the checklist’s "full transcript on every turn" requirement.
- The `AgentSession` struct’s `NativeData` field is used consistently across agents (Claude, Gemini), ensuring native format preservation.

---

### **6. Suggested Actions**
1. **Update the Guide**:
   - Add a section on graceful degradation and fallback strategies.
   - Clarify database-backed agent implementation.
   - Explicitly state the "no incremental diffs" requirement in the "Transcript Storage" section.

2. **Update the Checklist**:
   - Add a checklist item for `ProtectedDirs()`.
   - Add a checklist item for `HookHandler` implementation.
   - Reorganize the checklist to mirror the `Agent` interface structure.

3. **Add Examples**:
   - Include a database-backed agent example in the guide (e.g., Cursor).
   - Add a subagent example (e.g., Claude Tasks) to clarify `SubagentAwareExtractor`.

4. **Cross-Reference**:
   - Add links in the checklist to the guide’s relevant sections (e.g., "See [Transcript Storage](#transcript-storage) for implementation details").
   - Add a "Checklist Alignment" section to the guide, mapping each checklist item to the corresponding interface/method.

---

### **Conclusion**
The two documents are **largely aligned**, but the gaps above could lead to inconsistencies in new agent implementations. Addressing them would ensure that:
- New agents fully comply with the checklist’s requirements.
- The guide remains the authoritative source for implementation details.
- Edge cases (e.g., graceful degradation, database-backed agents) are handled consistently.

     5→## Core Principle: Full Transcript Storage
     6→
     7→Entire stores the **complete session transcript** at every checkpoint, not incremental diffs. This enables:
     8→
     9→- Simple rewind: restore the full transcript, agent resumes from that state
    10→- No dependency on previous checkpoints being intact
    11→- Consistent behavior across all checkpoint types (committed, uncommitted)
    12→
    13→**Each checkpoint must contain the full session history up to that point.**
    14→
    15→## Core Principle: Native Format Preservation
    16→
    17→Store transcripts in the **agent's native format**. Any transformation or normalization should only be done to support CLI features (rewind, resume, summarization, file extraction), not for backend or web UI consumption.
    18→
    19→**Why:**
    20→- The backend/web UI should handle format differences, not the CLI
    21→- Transforming for downstream consumers couples the CLI to their requirements
    22→- Native formats ensure compatibility with agent's own import/export tools
    23→- Reduces risk of data loss from lossy transformations
    24→- Format changes that break the UI can be fixed with a backend deploy; CLI changes require a full release cycle and user adoption
    25→
    26→**Do:**
    27→- Store the raw transcript as the agent produces it
    28→- Parse the native format when CLI features need specific data (e.g., extract file paths for `entire status`)
    29→- Let the backend normalize formats for display
    30→
    31→**Don't:**
    32→- Create a "universal transcript format" in the CLI
    33→- Transform logs to match what the web UI expects
    34→- Strip or restructure data to simplify backend processing
    35→- Create intermediate formats (e.g., converting JSON to JSONL for "easier parsing")
    36→- Reconstruct transcripts from events when a canonical export exists
    37→
    38→## Integration Checklist
    39→
    40→### Transcript Capture
    41→
    42→- [ ] **Full transcript on every turn**: At turn-end, capture the complete session transcript, not just events since the last checkpoint
    43→- [ ] **Resumed session handling**: When a user resumes an existing session, the transcript must include all historical messages, not just new ones since the plugin/hook loaded
    44→- [ ] **Use agent's canonical export**: Prefer the agent's native export command (e.g., `opencode export`, reading Claude's JSONL file) over manually reconstructing from events
    45→- [ ] **No custom formats**: Store the agent's native format directly in `NativeData` - do not convert between formats (e.g., JSON to JSONL) or create intermediate representations
    46→- [ ] **Graceful degradation**: If the canonical source is unavailable (e.g., agent shutting down), fall back to best-effort capture with clear documentation of limitations
    47→
    48→### Session Storage Abstraction
    49→
    50→- [ ] **`WriteSession` implementation**: Agent must implement `WriteSession(AgentSession)` to restore sessions
    51→- [ ] **File-based agents** (Claude, Gemini): Write `NativeData` to `SessionRef` path
    52→- [ ] **Database-backed agents**: Write `NativeData` to file, then import into native storage (the native format should be what the agent's import command expects)
    53→- [ ] **Single format per agent**: Store only the agent's native format in `NativeData` - no separate fields for different representations of the same data

# Agent Implementation Guide

## Architecture Overview

The Entire CLI uses **inversion of control** for agent integration: agents are passive data providers that translate their native hook payloads into normalized lifecycle events, and the framework handles all orchestration (state transitions, file detection, checkpoint saving, metadata generation). The flow is:

```
Agent hook invocation → ParseHookEvent() → Event → DispatchLifecycleEvent() → framework actions
```

An agent never calls strategy methods or manages session state directly. It only answers questions: "What event just happened?" and "What does the transcript say?"

## Quick Reference

### Core Interface (`Agent`)

Every agent must implement all 19 methods on the `Agent` interface:

| Group | Method | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Identity** | `Name()` | Registry key (e.g., `"claude-code"`) |
| | `Type()` | Display name for metadata (e.g., `"Claude Code"`) |
| | `Description()` | Human-readable description for UI |
| | `DetectPresence()` | Check if agent is configured in the repo |
| | `ProtectedDirs()` | Directories to preserve during rewind |
| **Event Mapping** | `HookNames()` | Hook verbs that become CLI subcommands |
| | `ParseHookEvent()` | **Core contribution surface** - translate native hooks to Events |
| **Transcript** | `ReadTranscript()` | Read raw transcript bytes |
| | `ChunkTranscript()` | Split large transcripts at format-aware boundaries |
| | `ReassembleTranscript()` | Recombine chunks into a single transcript |
| **Session Management** | `GetHookConfigPath()` | Path to hook config file |
| | `SupportsHooks()` | Whether agent supports lifecycle hooks |
| | `ParseHookInput()` | Parse hook callback input from stdin |
| | `GetSessionID()` | Extract session ID from hook input |
| | `GetSessionDir()` | Where agent stores session data |
| | `ResolveSessionFile()` | Path to session transcript file |
| | `ReadSession()` | Read session data from agent's storage |

 - Session logs are condensed to permanent `entire/checkpoints/v1` branch on user commits
 - Builds git trees in-memory using go-git plumbing APIs
 - Rewind restores files from shadow branch commit tree (does not use `git reset`)
-- **Location-independent transcript resolution** - transcript paths are always computed dynamically from the current repo location (via `agent.GetSessionDir` + `agent.ResolveSessionFile`), never stored in checkpoint metadata. This ensures restore/rewind works after repo relocation or across machines.
 - Tracks session state in `.git/entire-sessions/` (shared across worktrees)
 - **Shadow branch migration** - if user does stash/pull/rebase (HEAD changes without commit), shadow branch is automatically moved to new base commit
 - **Orphaned branch cleanup** - if a shadow branch exists without a corresponding session state file, it is automatically reset when a new session starts
